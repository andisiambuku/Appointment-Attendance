    "### Dataset Description \n",
    "\n",
    "**No-show appointments dataset is a collection of 100,000 medical appointments of patients in Brazil. It seeks to assist in finding reasons why people with appointments with doctors fail to show up for their appointments. There is ample information that will tell a story of why people do not show up and assist in mitigating this challenge. This will help answer questions in the analysis section and  overcome problems like inadequate management of patients ailments.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns in the dataset are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Patient ID - This is a unique identification for individual patients and it helps identify one patient from another.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Appointment ID - This is a unique identification for individual appointments an it is important to identify an appointment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gender- This column comprises of the genders of the patients who are either male of female. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scheduled day - This is the day a patient scheduled the appointmnet to see the doctor and it helps know the reason they miss appointments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Appointment day - This is the day a patient visits the doctor. It helps us know if the patient actually shows up.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age - This is how old the patient is. It helps us identify hich ages attend their appointments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Neighbourhood - This is the location of the health facility. It helps in determining which hospitals are most visited by patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scholarship - This shows if the patient is enrolled in the Bolsa Familia welfare program. This will help know if the program members are attending their appointments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Diabetes - This shows if the patient has Diabetes or not. This will help know if patients with Diabetes attend their appointments. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hipertension - This shows if the patient has Hipertension or not. This will help know if patients with Hipertension attend their appointments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alcoholism - This shows if the patient is an alcoholic. This will help know if patients with Alcoholism attend their appointments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handcap - This shows if the patient has a Handicap. This will help know if patients with Handicap attend their appointments. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- SMS received -This shows if the patient has recieved an SMS from the hospital. This will help know if patients receive a SMS from the hospital attend their appointments. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- No show - This shows if the patient has attended their appointmnet or not. This will help know if patients actually attend their appointments.\n",

    "The following are some of the questions that we seek to answer from the analysis of this dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How is the attendance to the appointments by the patients?\n",

    "\n",
    "2. What is the correlation between the independent variables and the dependent variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What factors are most important in predicting the attendance of the patients to their appointments?\n"

One option that you can take with this project is to do a lot of explorations in an initial notebook. These don't have to be organized, but make sure you use enough comments to understand the purpose of each code cell. Then, after you're done with your analysis, create a duplicate notebook where you will trim the excess and organize your steps so that you have a flowing, cohesive report."

You should compute the relevant statistics throughout the analysis when an inference is made about the data. Note that at least two or more kinds of plots should be created as part of the exploration, and you must  compare and show trends in the varied visualizations. \n",

This can be an exploratory relationship between three variables of interest, or looking at how two independent variables relate to a single dependent variable of interest. Lastly, you  should perform both single-variable (1d) and multiple-variable (2d) explorations.\n",
